Redundancy Detection System:

Cryptographic content hashing for exact duplicate detection
Similarity scoring using Jaccard similarity for near-duplicates
Configurable similarity threshold (90% by default)
Validation Mechanism:

Content validation rules (length, quality checks)
Separate verification step before database insertion
Thread-safe operations with locking
Cloud Database Integration:

SQLite database with unique constraints on content hashes
Batch processing with parallel execution
Statistics tracking for monitoring system performance
False Positive Handling:

Classification of entries as redundant or unique
Different storage treatment for redundant vs unique data
Detailed reasons for rejection
Performance Optimizations:

Content fingerprint caching
Batch processing with ThreadPoolExecutor
Connection pooling for database operations
API Interface:

Single item upload endpoint
Batch upload endpoint
Statistics endpoint for monitoring
